### <font color=red>What is Classification?</font>

**Classification is a Supervised Machine Learning technique.**  Classification, like Regression, uses labeled data from a training dataset to learn rules for making future predictions on unseen data. However, **Classification is used to predict the category membership of the categorical target value or label.** For Classification algorithms, you determine the probability of an observation to be part of a certain class or not. Therefore, you express the probability with a value between 0 and 1. A probability close to 1 means the observation is very likely to be part of a group or category.

**Simply put, Regression predicts a continuous variable while classification predicts a categorical variable.**

### <font color=orange>So What Are the Types of Classification?</font>

**Types of Classification**

>**Binary Classification -** This type of classification uses a decision rule to predict an observation to be a member of one of only two groups: churn/not churn, pass/fail, male/female, smoker/non-smoker, healthy/sick.

>**Multiclass Classification -** This type of classification uses a decision rule to predict an observation to be a member of one of three or more possible groups or categories: A/B/C, hot/warm/cold, Python/Java/C++/Go/C
